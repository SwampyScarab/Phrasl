Phrasl is a word game similar to Wordle, but the key difference is, rather than guessing words, you can guess individual letters and short phrases (eg. 'ing', 'ed', etc..)
The game is most similar to Hangman, but as an individual game
You get 8 lives and the words are varying in length
If a player guesses a correct letter, they do not lose lives, but if they guess incorrectly, they lose lives and chances
player earns points if they win (points won = lives left over after winning) so if you run out of guesses, you don't gain or lose points
by default, start at 0
User account, email and password to sign in, but username can be anything, no age limit
